# Cross-chain Rebase Token

A protocol that allows users to deposit into a vault and in return, receive rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance.

## Features

- **Dynamic Balance**: The `balanceOf` function is dynamic to show the increasing balance with time
- **Linear Growth**: Balance increases linearly with time
- **Action-based Minting**: Mint tokens to users every time they perform an action (minting, burning, transferring, or bridging)
- **Individual Interest Rates**: Each user gets an individually set interest rate based on the global interest rate at the time of deposit
- **Early Adopter Rewards**: Global interest rate can only decrease to incentivize/reward early adopters
- **Token Adoption**: Designed to increase token adoption
